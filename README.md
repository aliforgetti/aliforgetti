## Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ali!

I'm an electrical engineer turned data scientist with a keen interest in leveraging data science to make better sense of the world around me and to improve human well-being. I enjoy working on projects utilizing natural language processing and machine learning to answer important questions about human behavior and health.
